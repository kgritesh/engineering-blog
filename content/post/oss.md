The engineering team at Loanzen is a big time user of open source technologies and our entire technology stack is based on open source software. **OSS** is one of the most important reasons we have been able to move so fast and make tremendous strides in automating our loan workflow almost entirely. Each of us at Loanzen - both tech and non tech teams have this awareness that whatever we are building is minuscule as compared to the free and open source tools that we are using to build them. This is both humbling and inspiring. **Humbling** - because it makes us feel grateful towards the amazing contributors of these projects. **Inspiring** - because it inspires us to contribute back to the community as much as we can - both in terms of actual code/documentation/eg as well as monetarily.

As a company, we are at a stage where we are very confident about our business model and believe we are past the product market fit stage. We are now very keen on making meaningful contributions towards the open source community that has helped us so much. Over the last month we extracted some of the code from our codebase which we believe can add value to others and open sourced them [here](https://github.com/loanzen). We have also come up with a 4 point action plan that will help us to contribute more.

+ **Gamify OSS at Loanzen**. Every month we will be giving out an award and a gift voucher to an engineer who makes the most/best open source contribution. The contributions will be judged based on following criteria in descending order.

	* Contribution towards an existing major OSS project like programming languages, database, frameworks etc.

	* Contribution towards some existing popular open source library

	* Created some new open source project with proper documentations and test

	* Extracted some code from our codebase and made it open source. This should have documentation and tests.

+ **Monetary Contribution to OSS**. Every month we will tip one open source / project library. We will have engineers vote for their best projects and Loanzen will contribute to the one with most votes

+ **Hiring OSS Developers**. Always give strong preferences to developer who have done meaningful open source contributions while hiring.

+ **Encouragement towards OSS**. We encourage our tech team to see if they can open source whatever they are working on as part of their day job. Anything that we believe can help others and doesn't encapsulate our IP, we would want to make it public.

These all are just baby steps towards our goal of becoming very active contributors to OSS. I am very excited to see how this pans out and hoping that we are able to come up with contributions that help the community that we owe so much to.
